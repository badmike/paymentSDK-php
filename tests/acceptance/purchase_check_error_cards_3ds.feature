  As a user
  I want to check that I'm not able to make transactions with error cards

    Given I am on "Create Credit Card UI Page" page
    When I fill fields with <credit_card_data>
    And I enter "70" in field "Amount"
    And I choose "EUR" in field "Currency"
    And I click "Save"
    Then I am redirected to "Credit Card Reserve Page" page
    And I click "Redirect to 3-D Secure page"
    Then I am redirected to "Verified Page" page
